# 4 MATPLOTLIB - Bootcamp Assignment

## Background

What good is data without a plot to tell the story?!
To me....the end goal of any data analysis is to tell a story!

For this assignment we analyzed a ride-sharing company's complete recordset of rides.

## Bubble Plot

The objective was to build a bubble plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

## Pie Charts

I also made the following pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

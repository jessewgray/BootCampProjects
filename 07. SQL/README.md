# 7 SQL - Bootcamp Assignment

## Background

Enter relational databases! Before this bootcamp I kept hearing about SQL. It was always involed in any enterprise system I had used in my career in Operations whether it was the inventory ERP system or the facility software we used to measure the TMP and HUM of GMP production rooms. And it was that constant reminder, that there was this "elusive software called SQL" behind all the aspects of my job that I enjoyed, that drove me to learn more about data analytics and enroll in this bootcamp.  

## Sakila Database Queries

For this assignment we installed MySQL and used our laptops as a local server to host the 'sakila' database (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/). Fun fact....the word 'sakila' was the name of the MySQL dolphin (on the logo). In this assignemnt we had to perform various SQL queries such as:

* filters
* updates
* deletions
* joins
* subqueries

## Reflection

After using SQL, it was pretty evident to me the shortcomings of excel in comparison, especially when handling large amounts of data. And I learned that SQL is so much faster because it utilizes OLAP (Online analytical processing). Relational databases are going to be more efficient at computing because they utilize multidimentionality which allows for fast "roll-up", "drill-down", "slicing and dicing". In other words, it will only handle the data required for the query at hand, rather than handling all the data (i.e. like in an excel table).

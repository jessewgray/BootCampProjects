# 2 PYTHON - Bootcamp Assignment

## Background

This assignment was assigned after 3 classes of python (mid Oct 2018). That week was when I realized I truly loved programming and had a long way to go! During class, my instructor would say things like "in memory" and I had no idea what that meant. So I found a Python visualizer (http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) and for the first time I understood how loops and conditionals worked and what it meant for something to be stored in a memory address. Check it out! It really helped me!

Looking back on this assignment, there are a lot of things I would have done differently. Knowing what I know in pandas now I can say that this assignment could have been done a lot simpler. But this post is about my journey! That said.....here is the code I submitted for my assignment having a rudimentary knowledge of python. 

## PyBank

* In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing financial records (`budget_data.csv`) to calculate:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll

* In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process (`election_data.csv`) by calculating:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote

## PyBoss

In this challenge, I got to be boss! I oversee hundreds of employees. And the company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and the new system requires employee records to be stored completely differently.

My task was to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records (`employee_data1.csv` and `employee_data2.cs`) to the required format for the new HR system by doing the following:

  * The `Name` column should be split into separate `First Name` and `Last Name` columns.

  * The `DOB` data should be re-written into `MM/DD/YYYY` format.

  * The `SSN` data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.

  * The `State` data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.

## PyParagraph

In this challenge, I got to play the role of chief linguist at a local learning academy. My task was to create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage to do the following:

* Import a text file filled with a paragraph of your choosing.

* Assess the passage for each of the following:

  * Approximate word count

  * Approximate sentence count

  * Approximate letter count (per word)

  * Average sentence length (in words)

* As an example, this passage:
